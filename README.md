# wordcloud
Creating a wordcloud displaying my interests for my README.md

I consider myself a Master-of-none. So I felt plotting a wordcloud would be the most efficient way to represent my
preferences, attributing weights $\omega_i$ to each topic $i$.

I use [wordcloud](http://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/) library to generate the plot.
